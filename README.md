### Hi-hello 👋

I enjoy working on really challenging scientific questions that will make a long-term difference. 
My current focus is biology, but previously I developed a bunch of ML methods for CERN.

You can find my development/ML projects here on github: first of all, check einops (unless you already use it 😏).
